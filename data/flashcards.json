    "question": "What is the purpose of random_page_cost?",
    "answer": "Planner's estimate of random disk read cost",
    "explanation": "# Understanding random_page_cost\n\n## The Concept\n\n`random_page_cost` is a configuration parameter (found in PostgreSQL and some other databases) that represents the **query planner's estimated cost of fetching a disk page randomly** rather than sequentially. In PostgreSQL, it defaults to 4.0, meaning the planner assumes a random read is approximately 4 times more expensive than a sequential read (where `seq_page_cost` = 1.0).\n\nThis value feeds into the cost-based optimizer's calculations when deciding between different query execution strategies—particularly when choosing between sequential scans and index scans.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe optimizer uses `random_page_cost` to estimate which access method will be faster. Index scans require multiple random I/O operations (jumping to different disk locations), while sequential scans read contiguous blocks efficiently. If this parameter doesn't match your actual hardware, the planner may choose suboptimal plans.\n\n## Practical Example\n\nOn traditional spinning"

When set to a non-zero value, PostgreSQL ensures that at least this much WAL data is kept available, preventing premature recycling or deletion of WAL segment files.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIn streaming replication, standby servers continuously fetch WAL changes from the primary. If the standby falls behind or experiences network issues, the primary might recycle WAL files before the standby has a chance to consume them. This causes replication failure and requires a full re-synchronization"

Think of it as building a multi-layered highway system where each layer is a simplified graph connecting data points.\n\n**What m Controls**\n\nThe `m` parameter defines how many bidirectional connections (edges) each point maintains to its neighbors in each layer of the graph. When inserting a point, the algorithm searches upward through layers and establishes exactly `m` connections at each level.\n\n**Why It Matters**\n\nThis parameter directly balances the classic **speed vs. accuracy trade-off**:\n- **Higher m**: More connections mean more paths to explore during search, improving recall (finding true nearest neighbors) but increasing memory usage and query time\n- **Lower m**: Fewer connections reduce memory footprint and speed up queries, but risk missing relevant neighbors\n\nTypical values range from 5-100, with 16 being a common default in many implementations.\n\n**Practical Example**\n\nIf you're building a product recommendation system with 10 million items:\n- With `m=8`, you might achieve 85% recall using 4GB of memory\n- With `m=32`, you could reach 95% recall but need 12GB of memory\n\n**Related Concepts**\n- **efConstruction**: Controls the quality during index building (higher = better index, slower build)\n- **efSearch**: Number of candidates examined during queries\n- **M"
